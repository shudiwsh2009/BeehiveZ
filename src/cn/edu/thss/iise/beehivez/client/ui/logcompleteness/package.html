<title>The evaluation of information completeness of event logs</title>

<body>

	<P>Before process mining, it is necessarily important to determine whether or
not an event log is <i>globally complete</i>, i.e. containing all possible
behaviour of the underline process model, and/or <i>locally complete</i>,
i.e. containing all direct sucession relations between tasks of the
underline process model. Generally speaking the so-called <i>log
completeness problem</i>  consists of these two questions.

	<P>The problem has been studied and some approaches have been proposed to
evalutated the completeness of an given event log. To make use of as well as
to compare these approaches, a open source framework has been proposed and
implemented in Java(TM). Each approach can be implemented as a stand
alone Java(TM) package and ditribubted as a plugin of the framework. With the
framework, the researcher or the developer of new approaches would not have
to consider the parsing of event logs nor the collection of the evaluation
results but focus only on the approaches themselves. Please refer to
https://github.com/hunter99/CompletenessFramework for detail of the
framework.

	<P>By means of the plugin, <i>LogCompleteness</i>, for the Beehivez, the evaluation
framework of log completeness can also be used as a feature of the Beehivez. 
<UL>
	<LI>Click the tool bar icon of massive balls and a panel will be
	displayed,
	<LI>input the event logs for the completeness evaluation, e.g.<i>
		/data/logs/*.mxml</i>,
	<LI>select the configuration file for the evaluation, e.g. <i>
		conf/lx.xml</i>, and
	<LI>click the 'Evaluation' button to start evaluating process.
</UL>

	<P>All evaluation results are stored the application directory with a file
extention '.csv', which are in text format and can be opened with MS Office
or LibreOffice suites.

	<P>For more information on the evaluation of log completeness, please refer to

degree thesis (in Chinese).
